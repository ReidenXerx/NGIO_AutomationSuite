# 🚀 NGIO Automation Suite - Development Notes

## 🎯 Project Status

**Current Status**: Foundation complete, ready for core development in Cursor IDE

**Vision**: Transform the painful 4-hour manual NGIO grass cache generation process into a 5-minute setup + fully automated workflow.

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Complete Core Components** (Priority: HIGH)

#### Missing Core Files to Create:
```python
src/core/config_manager.py      # INI file backup/modify/restore
src/core/file_processor.py      # High-speed file renaming (port from existing tool)
src/core/progress_monitor.py    # Skyrim console output parsing & progress tracking

src/utils/logger.py             # Colored logging system
src/utils/skyrim_detector.py    # Game installation detection
src/utils/mod_manager.py        # MO2/Vortex integration
```

#### Key Implementation Notes:
- **ConfigManager**: Must safely backup `po3_SeasonsOfSkyrim.ini` and modify season type (1-4, then back to 5)
- **FileProcessor**: Port the existing multithreaded renamer from the other project
- **ProgressMonitor**: Parse Skyrim console for "Starting grass precache" and "Grass generation complete" messages

### 2. **Critical Technical Challenges**

#### Skyrim Console Output Parsing
```python
# Need to detect these messages from Skyrim console:
"Starting grass precache generation"
"Resuming grass cache generation"  
"Grass generation complete"
"Error: ..." (various crash patterns)
```

#### Process Monitoring Logic
```python
# Detection patterns needed:
- Normal completion: Look for completion message
- Crash: Process terminates unexpectedly  
- Hang: CPU < 2% for >5 minutes + no memory changes
- Infinite loop: Same message repeating for >10 minutes
```

#### INI File Management
```python
# Critical files to manage:
po3_SeasonsOfSkyrim.ini         # Season Type = 1,2,3,4,5
GrassControl.ini                # NGIO settings
# Must create backups before any modifications!
```

### 3. **Integration Points**

#### With Existing File Renamer
```python
# Port from GrassCacheRenamer_Python project:
- Multithreaded file processing engine
- Folder selection interface  
- Error handling and validation
- Performance optimizations
```

#### MO2 Integration Hooks
```python
# MO2 API access points:
- Profile switching
- Mod creation and management
- Plugin state management
- Overwrite folder handling
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Workflow
```
AutomationSuite.run_full_automation()
├── Setup & Validation
├── For each season (Winter→Spring→Summer→Autumn):
│   ├── ConfigManager.set_season(season_type)
│   ├── GameManager.launch_for_generation()
│   ├── ProgressMonitor.monitor_until_complete()
│   ├── FileProcessor.rename_files(season)
│   └── ModManager.create_mod_folder(season)
├── ConfigManager.restore_original_settings()
└── Generate completion report
```

### Error Recovery Strategy
```
Crash Detection → Log Details → Clean Process → Retry (max 5x)
Hang Detection → Force Kill → Clean State → Retry  
Config Corruption → Restore Backup → Restart Phase
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Installed
✅ Python 3.12.10 detected  
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ Professional project structure
✅ Requirements.txt with all dependencies

### For Cursor IDE Development

1. **Open Project**: `C:\Users\Vadim\Documents\NGIO_AutomationSuite`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Start with**: `src/core/config_manager.py` (easiest to implement first)

### Testing Strategy
```python
# Create test files in tests/ directory:
test_config_manager.py          # Test INI file operations
test_game_manager.py           # Mock Skyrim process testing  
test_file_processor.py         # Test with dummy .cgid files
test_integration.py            # End-to-end workflow testing
```

## 💡 Key Implementation Tips

### 1. **Safety First**
- ALWAYS backup config files before modification
- Validate file existence before any operations
- Implement graceful rollback on any failure

### 2. **Performance Considerations**
- Use multithreading for file operations (thousands of .cgid files)
- Implement progress callbacks for user feedback
- Cache expensive operations (file scanning, process detection)

### 3. **User Experience**
- Rich console output with colors and emojis
- Real-time progress updates
- Clear error messages with suggested solutions
- Comprehensive completion report

### 4. **Robustness**
- Handle all expected crash scenarios from NGIO guide
- Implement timeout mechanisms for hanging processes
- Graceful handling of user interruption (Ctrl+C)

## 📚 Reference Materials

### NGIO Guide Key Points
- Manual process takes 4+ seasons × 30-60 minutes each
- Skyrim crashes frequently during generation (expected)
- Manual restart required after each crash
- File renaming needed after each season (current bottleneck)
- Final step: restore seasonal mode (type 5)

### Technical References
- **psutil docs**: Process monitoring and management
- **configparser docs**: INI file handling
- **subprocess docs**: Process launching and control

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Performance Goals
- **Setup time**: < 5 minutes user interaction
- **File processing**: < 5 seconds (vs 10-15 seconds batch)
- **Crash recovery**: < 30 seconds restart time
- **Overall time savings**: 3+ hours of manual work eliminated

### Reliability Goals
- **Success rate**: >95% completion without user intervention
- **Error recovery**: Handle 100% of known crash patterns  
- **Config safety**: Zero config corruption incidents

## 🚀 Ready to Start!

The foundation is solid and the architecture is well-defined. Start with `ConfigManager` as it's the most straightforward, then move to `FileProcessor` (port from existing project), then tackle the complex `GameManager` process monitoring.

**This project has the potential to become THE essential tool for every Skyrim modder using NGIO!** 🌟

Good luck and happy coding! 🎮✨
