[size=5][color=#FF9800]⚠️ ANTIVIRUS DISCLAIMER[/color][/size]

[quote]
[size=4][color=#E91E63][b]THIS IS NOT A VIRUS![/b][/color][/size]

[b]Why antivirus might flag this tool:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Process Management:[/b] Tool launches and monitors Skyrim.exe (appears as "process injection" to some AVs)
[*][b]File Operations:[/b] Rapidly processes thousands of .cgid files (looks like "mass file modification")
[*][b]System Monitoring:[/b] Monitors CPU, memory, and file activity (appears as "system scanning")
[*][b]Automation Scripts:[/b] Python scripts with batch files (flagged as "potentially unwanted programs")
[*][b]New/Unknown Software:[/b] Not widely distributed yet, so not in AV whitelists
[/list]

[b][color=#4CAF50]This tool is 100% safe:[/color][/b]
[list]
[*]✅ [b]Open Source:[/b] Full source code available on GitHub for inspection
[*]✅ [b]No Network Activity:[/b] Tool works completely offline (except Python package downloads)
[*]✅ [b]No System Changes:[/b] Only modifies Skyrim files and creates mod archives
[*]✅ [b]No Admin Required:[/b] Runs with normal user permissions
[*]✅ [b]Portable:[/b] No installation, no registry changes, no system files modified
[/list]

[b][color=#FF5722]If your antivirus blocks it:[/color][/b]
[list]
[*]Add the extracted folder to your antivirus exclusions
[*]Temporarily disable real-time protection during use
[*]Use Windows Defender (generally has fewer false positives with Python tools)
[*]Download from official sources only (GitHub/Nexus)
[/list]

[b]Why we can't "fix" this:[/b] The tool's legitimate functionality (process monitoring, file operations) naturally triggers heuristic detection. This is common with automation tools.

[list]
[*][b]This tool automates NGIO,[/b] it doesn't replace it - NGIO must be installed first
[*][b]Keep NGIO mod ENABLED[/b] - you might want to generate more seasons later
[*][b]Requires Grass Cache Helper NG[/b] for seasonal switching functionality  
[*][b]First run may take longer[/b] as it validates your setup
[*][b]Heavy mod lists[/b] will take longer to generate (this is completely normal)
[*][b]Single-season workflow[/b] - generates one season at a time for optimal performance
