================================================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è ANTIVIRUS DISCLAIMER - THIS IS NOT A VIRUS!
================================================================================

WHY ANTIVIRUS MIGHT FLAG THIS TOOL:
‚Ä¢ Process Management: Tool launches and monitors Skyrim.exe (appears as 
  "process injection" to some antivirus software)
‚Ä¢ File Operations: Rapidly processes thousands of .cgid files (looks like 
  "mass file modification" to heuristic scanners)
‚Ä¢ System Monitoring: Monitors CPU, memory, and file activity (appears as 
  "system scanning" behavior)
‚Ä¢ Automation Scripts: Python scripts with batch files (flagged as 
  "potentially unwanted programs")
‚Ä¢ New/Unknown Software: Not widely distributed yet, so not in AV whitelists

THIS TOOL IS 100% SAFE:
‚úì Open Source: Full source code available on GitHub for inspection
‚úì No Network Activity: Tool works completely offline (except Python downloads)
‚úì No System Changes: Only modifies Skyrim files and creates mod archives
‚úì No Admin Required: Runs with normal user permissions
‚úì Portable: No installation, no registry changes, no system files modified

IF YOUR ANTIVIRUS BLOCKS IT:
‚Ä¢ Add the extracted folder to your antivirus exclusions
‚Ä¢ Temporarily disable real-time protection during use
‚Ä¢ Use Windows Defender (generally fewer false positives with Python tools)
‚Ä¢ Download from official sources only (GitHub/Nexus)

WHY WE CAN'T "FIX" THIS:
The tool's legitimate functionality (process monitoring, file operations) 
naturally triggers heuristic detection. This is common with automation tools.

1. üìñ OVERVIEW & WHAT THIS SOLVES
================================================================================

The NGIO Automation Suite transforms the painful 4+ hour manual NGIO grass 
cache generation process into a fully automated 5-minute setup that runs 
completely unattended.

BEFORE (Manual Process - PAINFUL):
‚úó 4+ hours of manual work across 4 seasons
‚úó Constant manual restarts when Skyrim crashes
‚úó Manual config editing for each season (Winter‚ÜíSpring‚ÜíSummer‚ÜíAutumn)
‚úó Manual file renaming after each 30-60 minute generation
‚úó High error rates and frustration
‚úó Constant babysitting required

AFTER (With Automation Suite - AMAZING):
‚úì 5 minutes setup, walk away
‚úì Run before bed, wake up completed
‚úì Fully automated crash recovery with resume
‚úì Intelligent process management
‚úì Real-time progress tracking
‚úì Consistent, reliable results

PERFECT FOR:
‚Ä¢ Users with heavy mod lists who experience frequent crashes
‚Ä¢ People tired of babysitting Skyrim through grass generation
‚Ä¢ Streamers/content creators who want set-and-forget automation
‚Ä¢ Anyone who values their time and wants professional results

4. Try launching Skyrim manually first to test

‚ùå "Skyrim won't launch" or "Process terminated immediately"
Problem: Skyrim installation or configuration issue
Solution:
1. Verify Skyrim path is correct (where SkyrimSE.exe is located)
2. Launch Skyrim manually first to ensure it works
3. Check for conflicting mods or mod manager issues
4. Try running as Administrator

‚ùå "Permission denied" or "Access denied" errors
Problem: Windows permissions blocking file operations

================================================================================
6. ‚ùì FAQ
================================================================================

Q: Do I need to disable NGIO after using this tool?
A: No! Keep NGIO enabled in case you want to generate more seasons later. 
   The generated archives work alongside NGIO.

Q: Can I use this without seasonal mods?
A: Yes! Select "Non-seasonal mode" during setup. This generates a universal 
   grass cache that works without seasonal dependencies.

Q: How long does generation take?
A: 20-60 minutes per season, depending on your mod list complexity. Heavy 
   grass mods and large worldspaces take longer.

Q: What if my generation gets interrupted?
A: The tool preserves progress in PrecacheGrass.txt. When you restart, it 
   will ask if you want to resume or start fresh.

Q: Can I generate multiple seasons at once?
A: No, the tool uses a single-season workflow for optimal performance and 
   disk space usage. Run it multiple times for different seasons.

Q: Does this work with other grass mods?
A: Yes! Any mod that adds grass objects will be included in the cache. The 
   tool works with the NGIO plugin, not specific grass mods.

Q: What's the difference between crash timeout and no-progress timeout?
A: Crash timeout (5min) detects when Skyrim process stops running. 
   No-progress timeout (10min) detects when generation stalls but process 
   is still alive.

Q: Can I use this on a different computer?
A: The portable version works on any Windows PC with Python installed. 
   Just copy the extracted folder and run it.
