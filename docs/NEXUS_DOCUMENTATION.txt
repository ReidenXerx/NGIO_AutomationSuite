================================================================================
8. üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

ISSUE: "Python is not installed"
SOLUTION: Let the tool install Python automatically, or download from python.org

ISSUE: "Skyrim executable not found"
SOLUTION: Verify the Skyrim path points to the folder containing SkyrimSE.exe

ISSUE: "Seasons of Skyrim config file not found"
SOLUTION: Install Seasons of Skyrim mod, or use non-seasonal mode

ISSUE: "No .cgid files found after generation"
SOLUTION: Check that NGIO is properly installed and configured

ISSUE: "Generation keeps failing"
SOLUTION: 
‚Ä¢ Reduce mod count temporarily
‚Ä¢ Increase crash retry limit
‚Ä¢ Check Skyrim stability manually first

ISSUE: "Archives not created"
SOLUTION: Check output directory permissions and available disk space

ISSUE: "Grass doesn't appear in-game"
SOLUTION:
‚Ä¢ Install Grass Cache Helper NG
‚Ä¢ Disable the original NGIO mod
‚Ä¢ Verify seasonal mod settings match cache

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
‚Ä¢ Heavy mod lists will take longer (this is normal)
‚Ä¢ Close other applications during generation
‚Ä¢ Ensure adequate free disk space
‚Ä¢ Consider generating fewer seasons initially

================================================================================

================================================================================
10. ‚ùì FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Do I need to disable NGIO before running this?
A: No, NGIO must be enabled during generation. Disable it after installing 
   the generated cache archives.

Q: Can I use this with mod managers?
A: Yes! The generated archives work with MO2, Vortex, and manual installation.

Q: What if my game crashes constantly?
A: The tool handles crashes automatically with resume functionality. It will 
   retry up to 5 times per season by default.

Q: Can I stop and resume later?
A: Yes, you can safely stop the tool. Progress is saved and will resume from 
   where it left off.

Q: Do I need Seasons of Skyrim?
A: Only for seasonal mode. Use non-seasonal mode if you don't have seasonal mods.

Q: How much disk space do I need?
A: At least 5GB free space. Heavy mod lists may need more.

Q: Can I generate just one season?
A: Yes, use custom selection to choose any combination of seasons.

Q: Will this work with my ENB/weather mods?
A: Yes, grass cache is compatible with all ENB and weather modifications.

Q: What if I have multiple Skyrim installations?
A: Run the tool separately for each installation with different output directories.

Q: Can I modify the generated files?
A: The archives contain standard .cgid files that can be modified like any 
   grass cache files.

‚Ä¢ Handles thousands of files efficiently
‚Ä¢ Validates file integrity during processing

CRASH DETECTION:
‚Ä¢ Process termination monitoring
‚Ä¢ Activity-based timeout (not hard time limits)
‚Ä¢ Hang detection via CPU and memory monitoring
‚Ä¢ Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
‚Ä¢ Safe backup and restore of INI files
