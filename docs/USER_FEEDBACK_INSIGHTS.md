# User Feedback Analysis & Improvements

## Feedback Source

**Context:** Post-release feedback from experienced user with large load order

## Key Insights from Feedback

### 1. **Large Load Order Challenge**
> "I have a very big load order so sometimes when it tries to start up SKSE might try and open before the last attempt at opening my load order has completed, which will cause a crash"

**What this tells us:**
- Users with 1000+ mods experience longer Skyrim startup times
- Multiple restart attempts can overlap if timing isn't managed properly
- Our current approach may not account for heavy load orders adequately

**Current Issue:**
- Fixed timeout values may be too aggressive for large load orders
- No adaptive timeout based on previous startup duration
- Risk of "death loop" where restarts happen too quickly

### 2. **Configuration Management is Appreciated**
> "being able to set the settings properly and minimise the amount of work is very convenient. for example, the packaging element of the mod is very nice"

**What this tells us:**
- Our INI backup/modification/restore system works well
- Archive creation feature is valued
- Users appreciate automation that reduces manual steps
- Config caching is meeting user needs

**Validation:** Core features are solid ✅

### 3. **Hang Time Configuration is Critical**
> "for those with very large load orders you'll have to be careful to set the 'hang time' appropriately otherwise if skyrim takes too long to start up again, then you might get it trying to start up again multiple times before it has had a chance to fully load"

**What this tells us:**
- Current hang detection timeout may be too short for large load orders
- Users need guidance on appropriate timeout values
- Timeout should be configurable and well-documented
- We need to provide recommendations based on load order size

**Problem Areas:**
- `crash_timeout_minutes = 5` may be too aggressive
- `no_progress_timeout_minutes = 10` needs better tuning
- No user guidance on setting these values
- No detection of "Skyrim is already running" scenario

### 4. **Restart Management Needs Refinement**
> "make sure 1) your timer for 'hangs' is appropriate and 2) you have enough restarts to see you through buggier zones"

**What this tells us:**
- Some worldspaces are inherently more crash-prone than others
- Restart count (`max_crash_retries = 5`) should be configurable
- Users need visibility into how many retries remain
- Different zones may need different strategies

**Insights:**
- 5 retries may not be enough for complex worldspaces
- We should track which worldspaces crash more often
- Users should see retry count in real-time

### 5. **Crash Detection Works Well**
> "this isn't this mod's fault, of course - it is just how grass cache generation works. however the ability of the script to detect this and ask if you just want to resume is very nice"

**What this tells us:**
- Resume functionality is a killer feature
- Users understand crashes aren't our fault
- Detection mechanism is working as expected
- Asking user for confirmation is appreciated (not fully automated)

**Validation:** Resume system is excellent ✅

### 6. **Abandonment Detection is Valuable**
> "also, it is nice that if you abandon a cache run on your own it will detect that and start again"

**What this tells us:**
- Users manually close Skyrim sometimes
- Our process termination detection works correctly
- Restarting after user abandonment is the right behavior

**Validation:** Process monitoring is solid ✅

### 7. **Overall Positive Experience**
> "it's some very nice code that is very helpful!"

**What this tells us:**
- Core functionality meets user needs
- Code quality is appreciated
- User would recommend to others

## Actionable Improvements

### Priority 1: Critical (Address Immediately)

#### 1.1 **Prevent "Death Loop" - Already Running Detection**
```python
# Add to GameManager
def is_skyrim_already_running(self) -> bool:
    """Check if Skyrim is already running before launching"""
    for proc in psutil.process_iter(['name', 'pid']):
        if proc.info['name'] in ['SkyrimSE.exe', 'SkyrimVR.exe', 'SKSE64_loader.exe']:
            self.logger.warning(f"⚠️ Skyrim already running (PID: {proc.info['pid']})")
            return True
    return False
```

#### 1.2 **Adaptive Hang Detection Based on Load Order Size**
```python
@dataclass
class AutomationConfig:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Make timeouts configurable with smart defaults
    startup_timeout_minutes: int = None  # Auto-calculate if None
    hang_detection_timeout_minutes: int = None  # Auto-calculate if None
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        # Auto-calculate timeouts if not set
        if self.startup_timeout_minutes is None:
            # Base: 3 minutes + 1 minute per 100 plugins
            plugin_count = self._estimate_plugin_count()
            self.startup_timeout_minutes = 3 + (plugin_count // 100)
        
        if self.hang_detection_timeout_minutes is None:
            # Should be at least 2x startup timeout
            self.hang_detection_timeout_minutes = self.startup_timeout_minutes * 2
```

#### 1.3 **Increase Default Retry Count**
```python
max_crash_retries: int = 10  # Was 5, increase to 10 for complex worldspaces
```

### Priority 2: High (Address Soon)

#### 2.1 **Startup Duration Tracking**
Track actual Skyrim startup times to provide adaptive timeouts:
```python
class GameManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.startup_history: List[float] = []  # Track last 5 startups
        self.average_startup_time: float = 180.0  # Default 3 minutes
    
    def track_startup_duration(self, duration: float):
        """Track startup duration and update average"""
        self.startup_history.append(duration)
        if len(self.startup_history) > 5:
            self.startup_history.pop(0)
        self.average_startup_time = sum(self.startup_history) / len(self.startup_history)
        
        # Use 2x average as hang detection threshold
        return self.average_startup_time * 2
```

#### 2.2 **Retry Counter Display**
Show users how many retries remain:
```python
self.logger.info(f"🔄 Retry {attempt}/{self.config.max_crash_retries} for {season.display_name}")
self.logger.info(f"💡 {self.config.max_crash_retries - attempt} retries remaining")
```

#### 2.3 **Wait Between Restart Attempts**
Prevent rapid-fire restarts:
```python
def _handle_crash_retry(self, season: Season, attempt: int):
    """Handle crash with intelligent retry logic"""
    wait_time = min(30 * attempt, 120)  # 30s, 60s, 90s, max 120s
    self.logger.info(f"⏳ Waiting {wait_time}s before retry {attempt}...")
    time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### Priority 3: Medium (Quality of Life)

#### 3.1 **Configuration Wizard for Large Load Orders**
Add interactive setup:
```python
def configure_for_load_order(self) -> AutomationConfig:
    """Interactive configuration based on load order size"""
    print("\n🔧 LOAD ORDER CONFIGURATION")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    plugin_count = self._detect_plugin_count()
    print(f"📦 Detected {plugin_count} plugins")
    
    if plugin_count > 500:
        print("\n⚠️ Large load order detected!")
        print("   Recommended settings for stability:")
        print(f"   - Startup timeout: {3 + plugin_count // 100} minutes")
        print(f"   - Hang detection: {(3 + plugin_count // 100) * 2} minutes")
        print(f"   - Max retries: 10-15")
        
        use_recommended = input("\n📋 Use recommended settings? (Y/n): ").strip().lower()
        if use_recommended != 'n':
            return self._apply_recommended_settings(plugin_count)
    
    return self._default_config()
```

#### 3.2 **Worldspace Crash Statistics**
Track which worldspaces are problematic:
```python
class AutomationStatistics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.worldspace_crash_count: Dict[str, int] = {}
        self.worldspace_success_rate: Dict[str, float] = {}
    
    def record_crash(self, worldspace: str):
        self.worldspace_crash_count[worldspace] = \
            self.worldspace_crash_count.get(worldspace, 0) + 1
    
    def get_crash_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate report of crash-prone worldspaces"""
        sorted_ws = sorted(
            self.worldspace_crash_count.items(), 
            key=lambda x: x[1], 
            reverse=True
        )
        return "\n".join([f"{ws}: {count} crashes" for ws, count in sorted_ws])
```

#### 3.3 **Enhanced Documentation**
Add section to README and user guide:

**"⚙️ Configuring for Large Load Orders"**
- Guide for users with 500+ mods
- Timeout calculation formula
- Signs your timeouts are too aggressive
- Troubleshooting death loops
